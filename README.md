# Giddy Guitar (wwdc17 scholarship)
This is the playground I submitted for the WWDC 2017 scholarship. Accepted!

This playground presents a guitar that you can strum by clicking on the lemon slices at the bottom. If you click the "Play a Song!" button on top, the computer will play "Yellow Submarine" by The Beatles with chords!
